Python	=> AWS 	 likhen
Typescript => CDK code likhen (infrastructure code bcz we hv intellisence in ts)

Cloud -> Serverless
1.1 - wo services AWS ki jinka model pehle sy bana hua he wo use kren, uski kitab b aagai he -> AI as A service (Book) => this will be followed
1.2 - Application CRUD graph databases -> import into sagemaker -> usi sy wahan model banana sekhen -> tenserflow sy deal kren.
1.3 - There is automatic somthng AI in sagemaker with ref. to graph databases (bad me ye pehle sequence smj rahe)

Graph Databases
-> CDK
-> Code
-> It can be conntected through Sagemaker
-> AI on Edge thru Green Grass.

Sagemaker (after creating model)

Tensorflow
Rust Embedded programming on Edge.
